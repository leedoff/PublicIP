1. Description

	PublicIP is a small 30 liner to make the public / external IP 
	address visible to the user. This can be achieved with other 
	Command-line tools, but I just wanted to be able to use a 
	memorizable command that anyone could use as if it was always
	there. 
	There is no particular reason why it is a C# based .exe and 
	not a simple .cmd or .bat other than " I don't want to support
	that horrible batch/cmd 'language' ".
	
2. How to use
	
	PublicIP is a Command-line based program. It needs to be run 
	via the windows-command-line (cmd.exe). To run the program 
	from cmd.exe, simply type the name of the file (PublicIP).
	Upper- and lower-case generally do not matter.
	
3. How it works
	
	PublicIP simply fetches a string from canihazip.com and writes 
	it to the console.
	
4. License information

	Use it for whatever you want, as long as it's not commercial.
	
5. Disclaimer
	
	PublicIP is a lazy 30 line C# program, which will neither 
	protect nor publish anything. It will need an internet 
	connection in order to work, and it will only establish a 
	connection to canihazip.com [5.196.192.222]. If it does anything
	else, please tell me (see "6. Contact") and stop using it,
	as you may have run into a damaged / infected version.
	
	If you download the program PublicIP_x64.exe from anywhere else than
	github.com/leedoff, it is your own responsibility to make sure
	that it is safe. If you're not sure about where you got
	the .exe from, delete it and download it from the repository.
